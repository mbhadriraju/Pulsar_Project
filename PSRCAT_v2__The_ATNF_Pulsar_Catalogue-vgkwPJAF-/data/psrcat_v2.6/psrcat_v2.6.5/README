This collection contains the database files and the scripts used to produce them

Collection structure
--------------------
OSS_LICENSE.txt: License
psrcat2.db:      Full SQLITE database file
psrcat.db:       Database output in the original PSRCAT v1 catalogue format.
README:          This file
scripts/

In the scripts/ directory we provide the code, scripts and auxiliary files 
(python and C) that can be used to recreate the database files. 

A .txt file is included for each publication which define the parameters 
to include for that publication.  

The psrcat_update.sh script provides the exact commands used to 
produce the final SQL database and makes use of other scripts 
available in that directory. 

The psrcatV2_V1.c file is used to convert the final SQL database back into the v1-catalogue format.
