# Pulsar Research Project
### This project is attempting to find a way to denoise wideband filterbank data for precision pulsar timing using multivariate variational mode decomposition and denoising CNNs.

So far data has been generated. Conditions have been simulated to be as realistic as possible.

Here's the dataset:
